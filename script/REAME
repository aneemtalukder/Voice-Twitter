HOW TO RUN:

Due to the many dependencies our script uses, it's most reliable to
be run from Gatto, Fluffy, or Sound Booth in the speech lab, where
the required libraries have been installed.

To run our script: run the following series of commands:

> cd /proj/speech/users/cs4706/yl2515/dialog
> python twitter.py

You can alternatively provide the flag --nohelp to the script, so no
help messages are read, resulting in a faster experience.

> python twitter.py --nohelp

Our app will automatically ask you for your twitter account, and
proceed to authenticate using Twitter's OAuth channel, at the prompt,
you'll need to copy the authentication code from the browser and 
paste in. For previously authenticated handles, the user access token
is saved to files, so this process can be skipped.



WHAT ARE ALL THE SUBDIRECTORIES IN THE SCRIPT'S DIRECTORY?

Good question, we're glad you asked! We'll explain below:

groups/
  In our system, we allow you to partition the people you follow
  into pre-defined groups, such as friends and family. This way,
  you can query for tweets later from those people only, such
  as "READ TWEETS IN MY TIMELINE IN FAMILY". All group configurations
  are saved to this directory, under the file name TwitterHandle.txt
  You can see italktweets.txt for sample format.

logs/
  We save all logs to this directory. The log file name is timestamped
  and contains transcriptions, all concept parameters, and state
  transitions. In addition, there are also subdirectories with the
  same names as the log files, containing all .wav files of user
  input and system output.
  
static/
  Some of our system output prompts are not generated by TTS but
  rather static sound clips (e.g., help messages). They are
  stored here.
  
tmp/
  This is the directory used for temporary files, mostly used for
  information exchange with other scripts.

tokens/
  All Twitter API access tokens are located here for user
  authentication.



WHAT ARE ALL THE DEPENDENCIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

Our script depends on the following:
- ASR: our speech recognition script located at 
  /proj/speech/users/cs4706/asrhw/yl2515/ 
- TTS: our text-to-speech system located at
  /proj/speech/users/cs4706/yl2515/timeline.pl
- Python packages: tweepy



CAN I RUN THIS SCRIPT FROM ANY DIRECTORIES?

Perhaps. We tried our best to make file persistence relative to the
working directory, but there are a few pieces (mostly with logging)
where we had to use fixed directory for exchanging information 
between scripts. So, we still advise you to run this script from
its native directory.
